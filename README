** THIS IS GAJABCHHABA ***

This is the classic Tic Tac Toe game writting in Visual C++. Nothing fancy, just
a working example of creating GUI.

It's a two player game, not one player against computer. 

Game control is mouse - each user takes turn with the mouse
and puts a X/O in the square of choice.
